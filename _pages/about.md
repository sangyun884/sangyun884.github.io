I'm a first-year ECE Ph.D. student at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) starting from Fall 2023. I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at [Soongsil University](http://eng.ssu.ac.kr). During my undergraduate years, I worked with Professors [Jaegul Choo](https://sites.google.com/site/jaegulchoo/) and [Jong Chul Ye](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HNMjoNEAAAAJ&hl=ko). Previously, I was a research intern at [SI Analytics](https://www.si-analytics.ai/eng), [Kakao Enterprise](https://www.kakaoenterprise.com/), and [NAVER AI Lab](https://clova.ai/en/research/research-area-detail.html?id=0).

**Research interest.** My goal is to develop powerful generative models and apply them to various applications including conditional sampling and planning. For that, I currently aim to build a generative model that can synthesize high-dimensional data such as videos in a *single forward pass*.

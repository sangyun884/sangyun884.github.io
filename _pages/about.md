# About Me

My name is Sangyun Lee (이상윤). I am an undergraduate majoring Computer Science at [Soongsil University](http://eng.ssu.ac.kr). I was a research intern at [SI Analytics](https://www.si-analytics.ai/eng) and [Kakao Enterprise](https://www.kakaoenterprise.com/) and was advised by Professor [Jaegul Choo](https://sites.google.com/site/jaegulchoo/) and Professor [Jong Chul Ye](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HNMjoNEAAAAJ&hl=ko). My goal is to build a generative model that can generate high-fidelity, diverse high-dimensional samples such as videos in a single forward pass. Currently, I'm working on diffusion models.

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at [Soongsil University](http://eng.ssu.ac.kr). My goal is to develop powerful generative models and apply them to various applications, including representation learning, inverse problems, and reasoning. For that, I aim to build a generative model that can synthesize high-fidelity, diverse high-dimensional samples such as videos in a *single forward pass*. Previously, I was a research intern at [SI Analytics](https://www.si-analytics.ai/eng) and [Kakao Enterprise](https://www.kakaoenterprise.com/), and I was advised by Professor [Jaegul Choo](https://sites.google.com/site/jaegulchoo/) and Professor [Jong Chul Ye](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HNMjoNEAAAAJ&hl=ko).

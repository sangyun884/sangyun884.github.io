# About

My name is Sangyun Lee (이상윤). I am an undergraduate student in Computer Science at <a href="http://eng.ssu.ac.kr" target="_blank"><strong>Soongsil University</strong></a>. I was a research intern at <a href="https://www.si-analytics.ai/eng" target="_blank"><strong>SI Analytics</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.kakaoenterprise.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Kakao Enterprise</strong></a>, and advised by [Jaegul Choo](https://sites.google.com/site/jaegulchoo/). I believe that <strong>deep generative models</strong> are the golden keys to a fundamental understanding of data.
